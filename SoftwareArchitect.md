## What is a Software Architect 
***
- Infrastructure Architect ( Servers, VMs, Network, Storage)
- Software Architect, Solution Architect or System architect ( to be discussed later)
- Enterprise Architect ( Works with CEO,CIO.... Streamlines the IT to support business)
***
  
Developers Knows What CAN Be Done  
Architect Knows What SHOULD Be Done.

Baseline Requirements: 
- Fast (Throughput)
- Secure (Security) 
- Reliable ( No single point of failure)

## The Architect's Process
***
- Understand the System's Requirements 
(What should the system do?)

- Understand the Non-Functional Requirements 
(Define Technical & Service Level Attributes # of Users,Loads,Volumes,Performance)

- Map the Componenets
(Represent the Tasks of the System. 2 Goals - System Functionality, Communicate your undertanding to the client, Non-Technical)

- Select the Technology Stack
(Back End, FrontEnd , Data Store)

- Design the Architecture
- Write the Architecture Document
- Support the Team
***

## Understanding System Requirements
***
- what the system should do (Funcional requirements).  
-- business flow.  
-- business services.  
-- user interfaces.  

- what should the system deal with.(Non-functional Requirements).  
-- Performance.  
-- Load   
-- Data Volume.   
-- C0ncurrent Users.    
-- SLA.
