# Motivation ( finding inspiration)
I believe there can be no better career than an inspired one. The inspired work that you spend all night thinking about. I seek to have such a career and thus I laid out my core career desires:  
  
Tackling meaningful problems.  
- To look back at my career and be proud of projects I been involved in.  
  
Be involved in the innovation and design of great products.  
- the collaborative inventive iterative process of finding the right product-market fit  
  
Developing and seeing the adoption of ur own created softwares products.  
- the joy that comes when people enjoy or become addicted using your products

## Brick by brick  
"You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall."
