# Motivation ( finding inspiration)
I believe there can be no better career than an inspired one. The inspired work that you spend all night thinking about. I seek to have such a career and thus I laid out my core career desires:  
  
Tackling meaningful problems.  
- To look back at my career and be proud of projects I been involved in.  
  
Be involved in the innovation and design of great products.  
- the collaborative inventive iterative process of finding the right product-market fit  
  
Developing and seeing the adoption of ur own created softwares products.  
- the joy that comes when people enjoy or become addicted using your products
